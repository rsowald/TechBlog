  ## Description
  [Deployed application](something@heroku.com)
  
  This is a full stack blogging application similar to WordPress. A user can view posts from other users on the home page, and, if signed in, they can 1) view, edit, or delete their own posts, and 2) comment on other users' posts. The app uses an Express server, Sequelize database model, and Sequelize session store to persist a login state. The server and database are deployed to Heroku, so this is a fully functional application from front to back end.
